    <h2>What is Dental Bonding?</h2>

    <p>
        Dental bonding is a procedure where a tooth-colored resin material is applied to the teeth and hardened with a special light. 
        This resin bonds directly to the tooth, effectively improving its shape, color, and strength. Patients often choose bonding to fix:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Cracked or chipped teeth</li>
        <li>Discolored or stained enamel</li>
        <li>Gaps between teeth</li>
        <li>Misshapen or uneven teeth</li>
        <li>Teeth that appear shorter than normal</li>
    </ul>
